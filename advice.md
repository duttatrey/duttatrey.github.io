Work in Progress.

>A mathematician was explaining his work to Tate, who looked bored. Eventually the mathematician asked "You don't find this interesting?"
>"No, no" said Tate, "I think it is very interesting, but I don't have time to be interested in everything that's interesting.

I’m putting together this page to compile advice I’ve found useful over the years, simultaneously or otherwise. My advice would be to read through some of the resources, make a mental note, and come back to it when you actually need direction or words of wisdom. I claim no responsibilities or intellectual right to these pieces of advice, but I do believe I am doing my part in spreading a good message.
