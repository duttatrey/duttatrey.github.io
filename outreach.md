### MathsCraft New Zealand
I've volunteered at several [MathsCraft New Zealand](www.mathscraftnz.org) events, starting with the MathsCraft Day in Martinborough. As stated on the website, Maths Craft brings maths to the masses by celebrating the links between mathematics and craft.

I started the [UC Students' Mathematics Colloquium](https://groups.google.com/g/uc-students-math-colloquium)  in October 2020, fresh after a wave of COVID-19 and subsequent continual lockdowns. We organised the talks for an audience of students and young researchers: students from Postgraduate and Honors courses presented their mathematical interests in 30-45 minute talks, with room for questions.
I've delivered a few talks, both whiteboard based and with slides.

### PGSA Radio

An avid supporter and believer in maintaining a fulfilling Postgraduate life, we started the PGSA Radio in 2020 with PlainsFM, broadcasting in their Studaemonia segment. We brought postgraduates from all streams and majors to talk about their postgraduate journey, including the tips and tricks that help them thrive and survive.
