Hi! I am Duttatrey.

I have a PhD in mathematics from [University of Canterbury]("http://www.canterbury.ac.nz"). I was funded by a PhD scholarship from the Marsden Grant.

Before coming to Christchurch, I completed my B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Mathematics from [UM-DAE CEBS, Mumbai](www.cbs.ac.in) in 2017.

My (mathematical) interests are in number theory, algebraic and arithmetic geometry. I employ computational tools to support my theoretical exploits.

Our first arXiv Preprint titled ["Brauer Manin Obstructions on hyperelliptic curves"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00230) is now available.
